Socket Programming with NodeJS:

	Socket.io helps in real-time bidirectional event-based communication.
	Socket.io is built on top of the Web Sockets API and Node.js.
	It has two parts:
		- Client Side Library
		- Server Side Library
		
Applications that can be developed with socket.io:

	1. Instant Messengers
	2. Push Notifications
	3. Collaboration Applicationss
	4. Online Gaming
	
----------------------------------------------------
	
Namespace:

- Socket.io Namespace means assigning different endpoints or paths.
- Namespace helps in minimizing the numbers of TCP connections or (resources) 
    at the same time hence separate concerns withing your application. 
- Namespaces are generally created on the server side.
- Default Namespace is the root Namespace i.e. '/'

-----------------------------------------------------

Joining Rooms:

- Within each Namespace, we can also define arbitrary channels that sockets can join or leave.
- These channels are called rooms.
